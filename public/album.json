    "strDescriptionEN": "Big Swing Face not only reissues the second recording by Buddy Rich & His Big Band but doubles the program with nine previously unissued performances from the same engagement at the Chez Club in Hollywood. Rich's orchestra was in its early prime, displaying a very impressive ensemble sound, charts by Bill Holman, Shorty Rogers, Bob Florence, Bill Potts and others, and such soloists as altoist Ernie Watts (a newcomer), trumpeter Bobby Shew, Jay Corre on tenor and the remarkable drummer/leader. Even with the presence of \"Norwegian Wood\" and \"The Beat Goes On\" (the latter features Rich's teenage daughter Cathe on a vocal), this is very much a swinging set. Rich has some outstanding solos and lots of drum breaks but does not hog the spotlight; he was justifiably proud of his band.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Norwegian Wood\n02. Big Swing Face\n03. Monitor Theme\n04. Wack Wack\n05. Love for Sale\n06. Mexicali Nose\n07. Willowcrest\n08. The Beat Goes On\n09. Bugle Call Rag\n10. Standing Up in a Hammock\n11. Chicago\n12. Lament for Lester\n13. Machine\n14. Silver Threads Among the Blues\n15. New Blues\n16. Old Timey\n17. Loose\n18. Apples (aka \"Gino\")",

    "strDescriptionEN": "In 1966, Buddy Rich left his gig as the highest-paid sideman in history with Harry James' band to start another big band of his own in Vegas. When Buddy finally dumped his backer (who wanted this to be a big ROCK band) because the charts were bad, quality arrangers like Oliver Nelson and Bill Reddie (house arranger at the Dunes Hotel) showed up and history was made! The result is one of the most exciting bands you'll EVER HEAR!\nThis band really PLAYED! I heard it in a little room in Oldtown Chicago called \"The Scotch Mist,\" and they nearly blew the customers' drinks right off the tables! The sound was different, too. The charts were great, but a lot of the uniqueness (I think) came from the \"barrel-house\" lead trombone of Jim Trimble \"pushing\" the Vegas trumpet section to new heights. You can really hear the \"middle\" of the band in their recordings.\n\nThe personnel were kind of anonymous in '66 (unless you were a musician), but many are very well known now (such as Bobby Shew, Carson Smith and Gene Quill). Don't be fooled ! In the 60's, you could walk into ANY hotel on \"The Strip\" and get blown away by the HOUSE BAND! These guys are simply GREAT! (Several of them are still hanging around Las Vegas, some in pretty surprising jobs...).\n\nThanks to Bob Belden and Dean Pratt (a trumpet-player and Rich alumnus), there are (9) extra tracks not on the original LP, but included on this CD (the five Oliver Nelson charts would make it worth the price of the album alone). So a fantastic album was just made EVEN BETTER by the reissue producers ! Get this, crank up the stereo and just TRY not to grin when the band rips through Bill Reddie's \"West Side Story Medley\" or Phil Wilson's \"Basically Blues.\"\n\nTracklist:\n01. Readymix\n02. Basically Blues\n03. Critic's Choice\n04. My Man's Gone Now\n05. Uptight\n06. Sister Sadie\n07. More Soul\n08. West Side Story Medley: Overture / Cool /Something's Coming / Somewhere",

    "strDescriptionEN": "Despite its title, this was actually the third album by Buddy Rich's still-new big band. The recording is taken from two different periods that, although only five months apart, find the band undergoing some major turnover; only six of the 15 sidemen are the same. With such players as altoist Ernie Watts, trumpeter Chuck Findley, and usually Jay Corre on tenor, this was a strong outfit. Most of the material (other than \"Chicago\" and \"I Can't Get Started\") was new; among the high points are \"The Rotten Kid,\" \"New Blues,\" and the complex \"Diabolus.\"\n\nTracklist:\n1. Away We Go (Allyn Ferguson)\n2. Machine (Bill Reddie)\n3. The Rotten Kid (Buddy Greco)\n4. New Blues (Donall Piestrup)\n5. Something For Willie (John Boice)\n6. Standing Up In A Hammock (Bill Potts)\n7. Chicago (Fred Fisher)\n8. Luv (Gerry Mulligan)\n9. I Can't Get Started (Vernon Duke/Ira Gershwin)\n10. Group Shot (Donall Piestrup)\n11.
